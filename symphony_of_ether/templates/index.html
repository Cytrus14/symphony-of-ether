The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31, is the closest spiral to our Milky Way. It is the most important one, located about 2,537 million light-years from Earth, and is often observed in the night sky. Andromeda is a connecting object in the Local Group, which contains our Galaxy and several other smaller devices, and is often studied by astronomers for the evolution of available spirals      </p>

The galaxy M108, also known as NGC 3556, is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Ursa Major. It was discovered by Pierre MÃ©chain in 1781 and is often observed by amateur astronomers due to its brightness. M108 has distinct spiral arms and is about 46 million light-years away from Earth.
